Introduction
============

This library is essentially intended to create various web versions of the Semux light HD Wallet.
They can be used both to replace the standard wallet developed by the creators of the Semux core project,
as well as for various specialized applications (dApps) based on the Semux ecosystem.

A wallet is a tool for creating asymmetric key pairs and digital signatures for transactions in the Semux network.
It should have the following main features:

- Random mnemonic phrase generation;
- Creation or recovery an account based on a mnemonic phrase;
- Deriving a sequence of key pairs for the account;
- Signing transaction messages;

Semux uses cryptography on elliptic curves ed25519, and this is why you canâ€™t use
standard Web Crypto API present in modern browsers.
The libSodium library is most suitable for implementing the algorithms used in Semux.
This library makes heavy use of libSodium.

Installation
------------

To build the project, QMAKE and EMSCRIPTEN compiler are used. The build process is quite complicated,
so the compiled files are laid out in the assets at the `release section <https://github.com/uno-labs/semux-light-core-wasm/releases>`_.

Download an archive ``uno_semux_light_core.tar.gz`` from assets on release page of this project.
Then unpack the archive into your project folder.

For use it in the browser project you have to import ``UnoSemuxLightCoreWasm.js`` into your HTML page: 

.. code-block:: html

    <script src="UnoSemuxLightCoreWasm.js"></script>
